# Digital Health Workshop

In this practical, you will be trying to break an AI autosegmentation model.

I have prepared a model which is in this repository, and whose weights can be downloaded into the notebook you will be using.

The model is trained using a modified version of the notebook here: https://github.com/afg1/RadNetAIDemo. the modifications are maily to allow training using a colab GPU, which means preprocessing data offline and minimising RAM usage

The notebook in this repo will load the model and have it ready for you to evaluate.

I have included a link to download what I think is a pretty good test set, you can find more images here: https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/
